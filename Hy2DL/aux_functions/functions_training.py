    """Basin-averaged Nash--Sutcliffe Efficiency.

    Loss function where the squared errors are weighed by the std of each basin. A description of this function is
    available at [#]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_sim : torch.Tensor
        simulated discharges.
    y_obs : torch.Tensor
        observed discharges.
    per_basin_target_std : torch.Tensor
        Standard deviation of the discharge (during training period) for the respective basins.

    Returns
    -------
    loss: torch.Tensor
        value of the basin-averaged NSE

    Weighted root mean squared error between measured and observed discharges. However it uses both the discharge and

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_sim : torch.Tensor
        simulated discharges.
    y_obs : torch.Tensor
